Prompt: what is going on with Sarah?
Response:
All three snippets show the same basic work conversation, but each time Sarah tacks on an extra, personal aside:

- Version 1: “I swear I’m peeing every five minutes today!”  
- Version 2: “I’ve been feeling nauseous in the mornings lately…”  
- Version 3: “I’m so tired today I can barely focus.”

Frequent urination, morning nausea, and unusual fatigue are classic early-pregnancy symptoms. Nothing is certain from a short chat log, but the pattern of complaints is exactly what many women notice in the first trimester. In other words, Sarah is probably hinting—perhaps unconsciously—that she thinks she might be pregnant.
