Sarah: Hey, quick question about the TPS report - do you know if we need Q3 metrics or just Q4 projections?
Mandy: I think it's both actually. Let me check the email...
Mandy: Yep, confirmed - Q3 actuals AND Q4 projections. Template should be in the shared drive
Sarah: Perfect! Are you handling the financial section?
Mandy: I can take financials since I have the budget numbers. Want me to do executive summary too?
Sarah: That would be great! I'll do operational metrics and recommendations then. Fair warning though - I might duck out for bathroom breaks. I swear I'm peeing every five minutes today!
Mandy: Should have my parts done by 2 PM
Sarah: Same here. Review call at 2:30?
Mandy: Sounds good!
