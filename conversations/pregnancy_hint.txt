Rachael: I saw Sarah at Target yesterday - wow, she's really starting to show now! She looks incredible though.
Mandy: I know, right? She's what, about five months along now? That little bump is so cute on her. She was wearing this fitted sweater when I saw her last week and she looked absolutely beautiful.
Rachael: Yes! And her face has that glow everyone talks about. You know how some people get that fuller, rosy look? She's definitely got it. Her cheeks look so healthy and bright.
Mandy: Oh totally. And have you noticed how thick her hair has gotten? It's like doubled in volume. She was complaining about having to buy new bras already, but honestly, everything just looks so good on her right now.
Rachael: She mentioned she finally had to start shopping in the maternity section last month. She was kind of bummed about giving up her regular jeans, but those maternity ones she got are actually really flattering. She's got that perfect little basketball belly going on.
Mandy: Aw, that's such a sweet way to put it! She told me she's been craving the weirdest things - pickles and ice cream together. But whatever she's eating is working because her skin looks flawless.
Rachael: She's handling everything so well. No morning sickness anymore, sleeping better, just seems really happy and healthy. She's absolutely blooming.
Mandy: She really is. This whole journey suits her so well.
