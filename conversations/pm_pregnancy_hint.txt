Rachel: Did you notice how the PM's been wearing those flowy tops lately?

Mandy: Yeah, and she mentioned feeling tired during the morning standup again

Rachel: I think she's starting to show a little bit

Mandy: How far along do you think she is? Maybe 4 months?

Rachel: Could be. She's been avoiding the coffee in the break room too

Mandy: That makes sense. Should we maybe offer to take on some of her workload?

Rachel: Good idea. The project deadlines are getting pretty intense
